# 2019-coronavirus
I would like to employ python to visualize the coronavirus distribution trend in China. Most code is from 
website https://blog.csdn.net/xufive/article/details/104093197#comments. I change it into English version. And for the
distrubtion curve and map have been attached. For the map code, there' s still a little problem that it can't show the 
province name. Hopefully, I can fix it later.
